# Possible changes for catch SR/PP

**What’s the goal?**

The most recent changes to catch SR/PP were in 2020 and very late 2014 before that. SR/PP in catch has huge room for improvement but it has been stagnant for a long while.

The goal here is to get some simpler changes out and revive community interest in improving catch SR/PP. Players should expect SR/PP to be an evolving system, not one that only changes twice every decade.

**What are these changes?**

This is not a rework, there are no fundamental changes to how SR/PP work, these are mostly iterative changes designed to be easy to implement. A number of changes are simply taken from the work done by bastoo0 who was working on a more fundamental rework previously.

**Why not a rework?**

A rework is much more complicated and would take a considerable amount more time to deliver. With a smaller scope we can improve areas like doubletime and fix issues like those pesky buzz sliders inflating maps beyond 10 stars now instead of waiting to include them in an overhaul. 

**Ok but what has actually changed?**

So this proposal is very much still subject to change until it’s in a spot the community is happy with, that means your feedback matters. Current discussion is mostly focused in bastoo0’s discord server here https://discord.gg/YEJBENvFzN, if you want to tweet about it make sure to @ me (sorceress4628) or I probably won’t see it. 

- A blanket doubletime buff and halftime nerf, this applies to every map
- A big buff to super speedy doubletime plays above AR 10
- A fix for buzz sliders inflating SR, this applies to maps like [Hand Crushed](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1253992#fruits/3208604)
- A nerf to [this pattern](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/911607430113288232/1162784104127942716/image.png?ex=653d3215&is=652abd15&hm=c3f37a95fa05eb1a9e435c796be8fba4e48c63a6d57f8bdcf4774134b91c18e6&)
- A nerf to same direction consecutive hyperdashes, they don’t require any change in input from the player and shouldn’t be worth so much
- Changes to misses and combo scaling, you can expect to see a noticeable increase to the PP on your non full combo plays, a one miss will still hurt but not quite as bad
- No Fail PP penalty reworked, a full combo with NF enabled will award full PP, sorry sandbaggers
- A few readability improvements to the existing code

_These changes are still in development with nothing set in stone yet_, this document will be updated as changes are added/tweaked/removed. Any suggestions are more than welcome.


**What next?**

The hope is to build a community around catch SR/PP that can keep momentum going, evolving the system over time with improvements, however small or big they may be.
